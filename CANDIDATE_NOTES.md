Hello!

I picked a basic setup with Rails API backend and React frontend to keep things modular and easy to iterate on. I didn't split logic into service classes to keep the code readable and inline because of the time constraint on the exercise. On the frontend I used localStorage to track login state since real auth wasn't needed. For accessibility I added some basic ARIA roles and labels (like role="main" and aria-live) and used semantic HTML where I could, but I didn't go crazy with it; just enough to show I know about WCAG without making the code feel bloated.
